# Veloxity

Veloxity is a Rust firmware implementation for the ROSflight ecosystem. The
current branch focuses on making the Rust firmware interchangeable with the
upstream ROSflight C firmware in the ROSflight multirotor simulator, while
keeping embedded firmware paths for RP2350/Pico 2 W, Nucleo-H753ZI, and Pixracer
Pro/STM32H7.

The repository is intentionally one Rust workspace. The core flight code,
MAVLink adapter, simulator FFI library, board crates, and platform crates share
contracts and must stay in sync.

## Quick Build

Run from the repository root:

```bash
cargo xtask check-host
cargo xtask test-host
cargo xtask check-board pico2w
cargo xtask check-board nucleo
cargo xtask check-board pixracerpro
```

The current RP2350/Pico 2 W hardware path uses the ISM330DHCX data-ready
interrupt for high-rate IMU intake and runs the full
estimator/controller/mixer/PWM pipeline at a fixed 1.5 kHz. The hot path is
IMU-only and reuses the latest command/sensor state; RC, barometer,
magnetometer, telemetry, parameters, and transport work run in bounded service
phases. Recent IMU delay work should focus on the board-local SPI register path
in the Pico firmware entrypoint. See
[RP2350 / Pico 2 W](docs/boards/rp2350-pico2w.md) for timing notes, current
caveats, and flash commands.

The current Pixracer Pro / STM32H7 path runs a fixed `400 Hz` control loop with
board-specific continuous service polling. Hardware tests at `921600` baud show
`399.5 Hz` host / `399.4 Hz` board-timestamp IMU telemetry, expected stream
rates for attitude, RC, TIMESYNC, barometer, output, status, heartbeat, and
parameters, zero CRC errors or MAVLink sequence gaps, and sub-`100 us`
producer-to-consumer IMU handoff latency in scope captures. See
[STM32 boards](docs/boards/stm32.md) for the Pixracer Pro timing decisions and
diagnostics.

For ROSflight simulation, source ROS 2 and the ROSflight workspace first, then
build the shim:

```bash
source scripts/build_and_source_ros2_shim.zsh
ros2 launch veloxity_sil_board_shim multirotor_standalone_sil.launch.py use_rviz:=true
```

The script builds:

- `target/debug/libsim.a`
- `workspace/install/veloxity_sil_board_shim`

Generated local artifacts can be removed with:

```bash
cargo xtask clean-generated
```

## Repository Rules

- Do not modify `rosflight_io` to make Veloxity work. Veloxity adapts to the
  existing ROSflight ROS 2 stack.
- Veloxity scripts assume ROS 2 and the ROSflight workspace are already sourced
  by the caller.
- Keep generated artifacts out of Git: `target/`, `workspace/`, ESP-IDF build
  directories, and runtime parameter stores are disposable.
- Prefer adding documentation under `docs/` and linking it from
  [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) instead of growing this README without
  structure.

## Upstream Context

Veloxity is built to interoperate with
[ROSflight](https://github.com/rosflight/rosflight). See the
[ROSflight docs](https://docs.rosflight.org/latest/) for system-level ROSflight
concepts and message/service behavior.
