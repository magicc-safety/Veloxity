# Repository Map

This repository is a Rust workspace plus a ROS 2 shim package. Source code lives in the workspace
members. Generated build outputs live in `target/` and `workspace/` and should not be committed.

## Top-Level Folders

| Path | Keep? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assets/` | Yes | Static project assets used by documentation. |
| `boards/` | Yes | Board applications. Each board crate chooses pins, peripherals, board I/O, PWM driver, and the concrete `World` type. |
| `comms/` | Yes | Communication adapters. `veloxity_mavlink` implements ROSflight MAVLink transport for the core firmware. |
| `crates/` | Yes | Firmware libraries. `veloxity_core` is the board-independent flight stack. |
| `docs/` | Yes | Current branch documentation. This should describe tested workflows and retained implementation paths. |
| `platforms/` | Yes | Reusable platform support shared by board crates. |
| `scripts/` | Yes | Repository helper scripts that orchestrate local builds. |
| `sim/` | Yes | Host simulator firmware crate and ROS 2 shim package. |
| `third_party/` | Yes | Vendored dependency patches needed by the workspace. |
| `tools/` | Yes | Standalone tools that are not part of the flight core, including the ESP32C5 ESP-NOW UART bridge. |
| `xtask/` | Yes | Repository command wrapper used for common build, test, flash, and cleanup commands. |
| `target/` | Generated | Cargo build output. Remove with `cargo xtask clean-generated`. |
| `workspace/` | Generated | Local colcon workspace used to build the ROS 2 shim overlay. Remove with `cargo xtask clean-generated`. |
| `rosflight_memory/` | Generated | Local runtime parameter/state artifact path from older runs. Remove with `cargo xtask clean-generated`. |

## Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Cargo package/crate | A Rust build unit with its own `Cargo.toml`. In this repo, `pico2w`, `veloxity_core`, `sim`, and `xtask` are packages. |
| `build.rs` | A Cargo build script. Cargo runs it before compiling that package. For `boards/pico2w`, it points the linker at `memory.x`, the RP2350 memory layout file. |
| Feature flag | A compile-time switch enabled with `--features`. Features can include optional dependencies, select alternate hardware behavior, or enable diagnostics. See [Feature flags](features.md). |
| Board crate | A package that adapts real hardware to `veloxity_core`, such as `boards/pico2w` or `boards/pixracerpro`. |
| Virtual board / runtime adapter | A non-physical board boundary. `sim/firmware` adapts ROSflight simulator data into the same core firmware contracts used by hardware boards. |
| `BoardIo` | The core trait a board/runtime implements to provide sensors, outputs, service hooks, and board status to `World`. |
| Sensor bus | Core-owned sensor resources containing the latest raw or processed packets handed in by a board/runtime. |
| Service sensor bus/path | The slower sensor/service side of the realtime scheduler. It handles non-IMU sensors, RC packet drain, command handling, telemetry, and board service work outside the fast IMU/control path. |
| PWM | Actuator output command path. In this repo the core owns generic PWM/output concepts; a board driver may implement PWM-like or DShot-facing physical output. |
| DShot | A digital ESC command protocol. Pico 2 W configuration includes DShot-oriented ESC pinout, while the core output layer stays protocol-neutral. |
| MAVLink frame | A complete MAVLink wire packet with header, payload, checksum, and sequence number. |
| MAVLink message | The decoded semantic payload inside a frame, such as heartbeat, RC channels, or ROSflight status. |
| Downlink | Vehicle-to-ground-station traffic emitted by Veloxity. |
| Sequence number | MAVLink packet counter used by receivers/test tools to detect gaps or dropped frames. |
| ODR | Output data rate: the hardware sample production rate of a sensor, especially the IMU. |

## Rust Workspace Members

The workspace is declared in `Cargo.toml`.

| Member | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/veloxity_core` | `no_std` flight stack: params, state machine, sensors, estimator, controller, mixer, PWM, telemetry scheduling, and the `World` scheduler. |
| `comms/veloxity_mavlink` | MAVLink parser and ROSflight MAVLink adapter implementing `CommInterface`. |
| `sim/firmware` | Host-side Rust firmware static library and FFI boundary for the ROS 2 shim. |
| `boards/pico2w` | RP2350/Pico 2 W board firmware and hardware probes. |
| `boards/nucleo` | Nucleo-H753ZI board firmware. |
| `boards/pixracerpro` | Pixracer Pro board firmware. |
| `platforms/rp2350` | Thin RP2350 platform crate. It re-exports the Embassy RP HAL as `rp2350_platform::hal` and holds early shared metadata for multicore and PIO allocation. |
| `platforms/stm_32` | Shared STM32/Embassy peripheral drivers. |
| `xtask` | Local command runner invoked as `cargo xtask ...`. |

Root `cargo build` uses workspace `default-members`, which are host-compatible:

```text
comms/veloxity_mavlink
crates/veloxity_core
sim/firmware
xtask
```

Embedded board crates are built explicitly with `cargo xtask check-board ...` or
`cargo xtask build-board ...` because they target Cortex-M.

## Source Boundaries

### Core

`crates/veloxity_core` must stay board-independent. It defines traits such as `BoardIo`,
`CommInterface`, `Estimator`, `Controller`, `Mixer`, and `PwmDriver`. Board crates and sim crates
provide concrete implementations.

### Communication

`comms/veloxity_mavlink` is the protocol adapter. Core owns protocol-neutral message structs and
command handling; `veloxity_mavlink` parses and emits MAVLink frames.

### Simulation

The simulator is a runtime adapter, or virtual board. It is not under `boards/` because it is split
between a host Rust static library and a ROS 2 C++ package, but architecturally it plays the same
role as a board crate: it adapts an external runtime into `veloxity_core`.

`sim/firmware` exposes the Rust firmware through C ABI functions such as `veloxity_sim_create`,
`veloxity_sim_set_sensors`, `veloxity_sim_run_once`, and `veloxity_sim_get_pwm`. It owns the
simulator-side `BoardIo` implementation.

`sim/ros2/veloxity_sil_board_shim` is a ROS 2 package. It links `target/debug/libsim.a` and presents
the Rust firmware as the SIL board endpoint expected by ROSflight.

### Board Crates

Board crates own physical integration:

- pin assignments
- peripheral initialization
- sensor queues
- serial or mailbox transport
- PWM output driver
- World instantiation

They should not reimplement flight logic that belongs in `veloxity_core`.

Current RP2350/Pico 2 W source is organized as:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `boards/pico2w/build.rs` | Cargo build script that adds the board crate directory to the linker search path so `memory.x` is found. |
| `boards/pico2w/memory.x` | RP2350 memory layout consumed by the embedded linker. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/bin/veloxity.rs` | Main RP2350 firmware entry point, Embassy task setup, core split, and IMU output-data-rate feature selection. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/lib.rs` | Library module declarations for the Pico board crate. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/config.rs` | Board pinout, core-role, mailbox, and PIO allocation metadata. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/board.rs` | `BoardIo` implementation, sensor queue drains, serial flush budget, and service hooks. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/pwm.rs` | PIO PWM/DShot-facing actuator output driver implementation. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/ism330dhcx.rs` | ISM330DHCX data-ready/SPI packet producer path. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/barometer.rs` | Barometer packet path. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/gy91.rs` | Legacy GY-91/BMP280 support used as a low-rate pressure path. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/gps.rs` | GPS and magnetometer path. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/rc_receiver.rs` | CRSF receiver path feeding service-side RC state. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/comms_core.rs` | Core-to-transport MAVLink mailbox used by UART/ESP-NOW testing. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/pio_uart_dma.rs` | PIO UART helper used by Pico serial paths. |
| `boards/pico2w/src/bin/*_probe.rs` | Hardware bring-up probes for individual buses, sensors, and serial paths. |
| `platforms/rp2350/src/lib.rs` | Re-exports Embassy RP as `rp2350_platform::hal`. Pico code imports the HAL through this crate. |
| `platforms/rp2350/src/multicore.rs` | Early shared RP2350 core-role metadata used by Pico config. |
| `platforms/rp2350/src/pio.rs` | Early shared PIO allocation metadata used by Pico config. |

Current retained STM32 work is concentrated in:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `boards/nucleo/src/bin/veloxity.rs` | Nucleo-H753ZI firmware entry point and `World` construction. |
| `boards/nucleo/src/board.rs` | Nucleo `BoardIo` and board setup. |
| `boards/pixracerpro/src/bin/veloxity.rs` | Pixracer Pro firmware entry point and `World` construction. |
| `boards/pixracerpro/src/board.rs` | Pixracer Pro `BoardIo` and board setup. |
| `boards/pixracerpro/src/pwm.rs` | Pixracer Pro PWM driver. |
| `platforms/stm_32/src/peripherals/` | Shared STM32 sensor, serial, and signal-task drivers. |
| `platforms/stm_32/stm32h7x3_common.rs` | Shared STM32H7 configuration. |

### Platform Crates

Platform crates own reusable chip-family code. Board crates depend on them when a concept applies
to more than one board.

`platforms/rp2350` is intentionally thin today. It is not a complete hardware abstraction layer of
Veloxity's own; it primarily centralizes the Embassy RP HAL import and a small amount of RP2350
metadata. Keep that dependency only while Pico code imports through `rp2350_platform::hal` or uses
the shared metadata types. If future Pico code stops using it, remove the dependency instead of
leaving an unused placeholder.

## Vendored Dependency Patches

The root `Cargo.toml` contains:

```toml
[patch.crates-io]
ism330dhcx-rs = { path = "third_party/ism330dhcx-rs" }
```

This is a deliberate Cargo patch. Any dependency that asks for `ism330dhcx-rs` is resolved to the
checked-in `third_party/ism330dhcx-rs` directory instead of the version from crates.io. Treat that
directory as a vendored external driver plus local patch surface, not as Veloxity-owned flight
logic. If the patch is no longer needed, remove the `[patch.crates-io]` entry and verify the Pico
IMU path against the published crate.

## Generated Files

These are disposable:

```text
target/
workspace/build/
workspace/install/
workspace/log/
rosflight_memory/
tools/__pycache__/
tools/espnow_uart_bridge/build*/
tools/espnow_uart_bridge/sdkconfig
tools/espnow_uart_bridge/dependencies.lock
```

Clean them with:

```bash
cargo xtask clean-generated
```

Do not delete source defaults such as `tools/espnow_uart_bridge/sdkconfig.*.defaults`; those are the
checked-in build configurations for the bridge roles.
