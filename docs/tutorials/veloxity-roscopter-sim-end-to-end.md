# Veloxity ROScopter Sim End-to-End

This guide runs the Veloxity Rust firmware inside the ROSflight standalone
multirotor simulator, initializes that firmware through `rosflight_io`, then
starts ROScopter autonomy and loads a waypoint mission.

> [!INFO]
>
>   The words below are intentionally specific:
>
>   - **Build the shim** means compile the Rust simulator library and the C++ ROS
>     2 bridge.
>   - **Start the simulator** means launch ROSflight standalone sim,
>     `rosflight_io`, and the Veloxity Rust firmware endpoint.
>   - **Initialize the running firmware** means load firmware params, calibrate
>     IMU/baro, and write params through `rosflight_io` services.
>   - **Launch ROScopter** means start the autonomy stack after the firmware
>     endpoint is already alive.

> [!NOTE]
>
> These commands assume ROS 2 and the ROSflight workspace have already been
> sourced by your shell. Veloxity scripts use the caller's environment; they do
> not source external ROSflight helper scripts.

## Terminal Layout

Use separate terminals so long-running nodes stay visible.

| Terminal   | Purpose                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Terminal 1 | Build the shim, then keep the Veloxity simulator running |
| Terminal 2 | Initialize the running firmware                          |
| Terminal 3 | Launch ROScopter autonomy                                |
| Terminal 4 | Load missions, publish waypoints, arm, monitor           |

## Phase 1: Build The Shim

**Terminal 1**

```bash
cd /home/skink/projects/ROSflight/.distrobox-home/ROSflight/Veloxity
source scripts/build_and_source_ros2_shim.zsh
```

This builds:

- `target/debug/libsim.a`: Rust sim firmware static library
- `veloxity_sil_board_shim`: ROS 2 C++ FFI bridge

Optional compile-only check:

```bash
cargo test -p sim
zsh scripts/build_and_source_ros2_shim.zsh
```

> [!TIP]
>
> The first command should usually be run with `source` so the built overlay is
> available in the current terminal.

## Phase 2: Start The Simulator And Rust Firmware

**Terminal 1**

```bash
export ROS_LOG_DIR=/tmp/veloxity-ros-log

ros2 launch veloxity_sil_board_shim multirotor_standalone_sil.launch.py \
  use_rviz:=true
```

The launch defaults to:

```bash
firmware:=veloxity
```

That means the simulator uses the Rust firmware endpoint:

```text
/veloxity_sil_board
```

instead of upstream C firmware:

```text
/sil_board
```

Both provide the `sil_board/run` service expected by `rosflight_sil_manager`.

Expected startup lines:

```text
veloxity_sil_board ready: service=sil_board/run, pwm=sim/pwm_output
rosflight_io: Connecting over UDP to "localhost:14525", from "localhost:14520"
rosflight_io: Got HEARTBEAT, connected.
rosflight_io: Received all parameters
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> Do not close Terminal 1 after this. It is the simulator and firmware process.

### Compare Against C Firmware

Use this only when you specifically want the upstream ROSflight C firmware
endpoint:

```bash
ros2 launch veloxity_sil_board_shim multirotor_standalone_sil.launch.py \
  firmware:=c \
  use_rviz:=true
```

Run the same firmware init, mission load, arm, and override sequence for both
endpoints when checking parity. The Veloxity FFI shim is expected to present the
same ROSflight SIL boundary as the C firmware: `rosflight_sil_manager` calls
`sil_board/run`, sensor data enters through the standalone sim topics, MAVLink
goes through unmodified `rosflight_io`, and motor output is published on
`sim/pwm_output`.

One important detail is the IMU handoff. The shim latches the latest IMU sample
after the first `sim/sensors/imu/data` message and includes that sample on every
firmware step. This avoids false ROScopter IMU silence warnings caused by phase
drift between the 400 Hz IMU publisher and the 400 Hz `sil_board/run` service
timer. Lower-rate sensors remain availability-gated.

Brief `Autopilot ERROR: Unhealthy estimator` messages can occur around
computer-control and mode transitions with both the Veloxity endpoint and
upstream C endpoint. Treat those as ROSflight/C parity behavior unless they are
paired with persistent ROScopter sensor silence warnings.

## Phase 3: Initialize The Running Firmware

The firmware process is already running in Terminal 1. This phase sends setup
commands to it through `rosflight_io`.

**Terminal 2**

```bash
cd /home/skink/projects/ROSflight/.distrobox-home/ROSflight/Veloxity
source workspace/install/setup.zsh
```

Verify the simulator and Rust firmware endpoint are visible:

```bash
ros2 node list
```

You should see at least:

```text
/rosflight_io
/veloxity_sil_board
```

### Recommended: Veloxity Convenience Init

Run:

```bash
ros2 launch veloxity_sil_board_shim veloxity_multirotor_init_firmware.launch.py
```

This sends the following service calls in order:

1. `/param_load_from_file`
2. `/calibrate_imu`
3. `/calibrate_baro`
4. `/param_write`

> [!note]
>
> This is the Veloxity version of the ROSflight tutorial's convenience script.
> It adds barometer calibration, which the upstream ROSflight convenience launch
> does not perform.

Optional arguments:

```bash
ros2 launch veloxity_sil_board_shim veloxity_multirotor_init_firmware.launch.py \
  param_file:=/path/to/multirotor_combined.yaml \
  write_delay_s:=10
```

### Manual Init Equivalent

Use this when debugging individual service calls.

```bash
cd /home/skink/projects/ROSflight/.distrobox-home/ROSflight/rosflight/workspace/src/rosflight_ros_pkgs/rosflight_sim/params

ros2 service call /param_load_from_file rosflight_msgs/srv/ParamFile \
  "{filename: $(pwd)/multirotor_firmware/multirotor_combined.yaml}"

ros2 service call /calibrate_imu std_srvs/srv/Trigger
ros2 service call /calibrate_baro std_srvs/srv/Trigger
ros2 service call /param_write std_srvs/srv/Trigger
```

Watch Terminal 1 during init. You should see parameter traffic and the startup
calibration errors recover.

### Motor Output Isolation

Use `MTR_OUT_MASK` when checking motor order one output at a time. The mask
is applied inside Veloxity after normal arming and idle-throttle handling, so
disabled motor outputs stay at zero command even if `ARM_SPIN_MOTORS` is enabled.

Mask values are 0-based bitmasks:

```text
-1: normal, all motor outputs pass through
 0: all motor outputs forced to zero
 1: only motor/output 0 enabled
 2: only motor/output 1 enabled
 4: only motor/output 2 enabled
 8: only motor/output 3 enabled
```

Set the mask through unmodified `rosflight_io`:

```bash
ros2 service call /param_set rosflight_msgs/srv/ParamSet \
  "{name: MTR_OUT_MASK, value: 1.0}"
```

Then arm the firmware and watch the physical motor or the sim output topic:

```bash
ros2 service call /toggle_arm std_srvs/srv/Trigger
ros2 topic echo /sim/pwm_output --once
```

In the simulator, a disabled motor channel should read `1000` us. The enabled
motor channel should rise above `1000` us when the vehicle is armed and idle
spin or throttle command is active. For hardware tests, remove props, start with
`MTR_OUT_MASK=0`, then step through masks `1`, `2`, `4`, and `8`.

Return to normal operation when finished:

```bash
ros2 service call /param_set rosflight_msgs/srv/ParamSet \
  "{name: MTR_OUT_MASK, value: -1.0}"
```

### Persistent Veloxity Params

Veloxity FFI sim parameters are saved through `VELOXITY_SIM_PARAM_DIR`.

The multirotor standalone launch defaults to:

```text
/tmp/veloxity-sim-params/multirotor
```

Use a persistent path if you want params to survive cleanup of `/tmp`:

```bash
ros2 launch veloxity_sil_board_shim multirotor_standalone_sil.launch.py \
  veloxity_param_dir:=/some/persistent/path
```

## Phase 4: Launch ROScopter Autonomy

Keep Terminal 1 running.

!!! info

    For service-based arming and override control, the standalone sim should be
    running with the built-in RC node enabled. That is the default. If you set it
    explicitly, use:
    ```bash
    use_builtin_rc:=true
    ```

**Terminal 3**

```bash
cd /home/skink/projects/ROSflight/.distrobox-home/ROSflight/Veloxity
source workspace/install/setup.zsh

ros2 launch roscopter_sim sim.launch.py
```

Expected ROScopter nodes include:

```text
/autopilot
/estimator
/external_attitude_transcriber
/path_manager
/path_planner
/roscopter_truth
/trajectory_follower
```

Check with:

```bash
ros2 node list
```

## Phase 5: Load A Mission

**Terminal 4**

```bash
cd /home/skink/projects/ROSflight/.distrobox-home/ROSflight/Veloxity
source workspace/install/setup.zsh
```

Optional waypoint visualization:

```bash
ros2 run roscopter_gcs rviz_waypoint_publisher
```

Load the default ROScopter mission:

```bash
cd /home/skink/projects/ROSflight/.distrobox-home/ROSflight/rosflight/workspace/src/roscopter/roscopter/params

ros2 service call /path_planner/load_mission_from_file rosflight_msgs/srv/ParamFile \
  "{filename: $(pwd)/multirotor_mission.yaml}"
```

Verify waypoints:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /waypoints
```

Publish the next queued waypoint:

```bash
ros2 service call /path_planner/publish_next_waypoint std_srvs/srv/Trigger
```

Publish all initial waypoints:

```bash
ros2 param set /path_planner num_waypoints_to_publish_at_start 100
```

Manual waypoint example:

```bash
ros2 service call /path_planner/add_waypoint roscopter_msgs/srv/AddWaypoint \
  "{wp: {type: 1, w: [5.0, 5.0, -4.0], speed: 4.0, psi: 0.0, use_lla: false}, publish_now: true}"
```

## Phase 6: Enable Autonomous Flight

If `rc.py` is running and you are not using VimFly or a transmitter:

```bash
ros2 service call /toggle_arm std_srvs/srv/Trigger
ros2 service call /toggle_override std_srvs/srv/Trigger
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> ROSflight starts with RC override enabled by default. Autonomy cannot control
> the vehicle until override is disabled.

## Phase 7: Monitor Flight

Useful topic echoes:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /estimated_state
ros2 topic echo /high_level_command
ros2 topic echo /command
ros2 topic echo /status
```

Useful rate checks:

```bash
ros2 topic hz /command
ros2 topic hz /sim/pwm_output
ros2 topic hz /imu/data
ros2 topic hz /sim/truth_state
```

If the vehicle drifts or you need to reset the standalone sim state:

```bash
ros2 service call /dynamics/set_sim_state rosflight_msgs/srv/SetSimState
```

## Debug Checks

Use these before blaming ROScopter:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /sim/truth_state --once
ros2 topic echo /imu/data --once
ros2 topic echo /baro --once
ros2 topic echo /status --once
ros2 topic echo /rc_raw --once
ros2 topic echo /sim/pwm_output --once
```

!!! bug

    If `/sim/truth_state` is quiet but `/imu/data`, `/baro`, `/status`, or
    timestamps look impossible, the problem is likely in the firmware bridge or
    firmware telemetry path, not in ROScopter mission logic. `/imu/data` and other
    firmware telemetry should have normal ROS stamps after timesync; they should not
    show negative seconds.
